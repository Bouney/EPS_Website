        of graphic representation through the use of CAD workstations,
        drafting machines and drafting instruments. Students will have
        access to multiple technologies including vinyl cutters, soldering
        irons, hot wire cutters, laser engravers and 3D printers.
        Students are encouraged to work at their own pace while
        striving to improve themselves. They should find satisfaction in
        their progress and skill development as careful, quality work is
        stressed while communicating through graphic representation.
        Pictorials, Renderings, Orthographic and Isometric Projections
        will be used to develop skill and design appreciation by the
        student. In addition, relationships between form and function
        will be explored. This course will help students acquire the

        This Computer Aided Drafting and Design course builds on the
        skills and fundamentals taught in TED 10 or DDF 11. Three
        dimensional models and animations are created using AutoCAD,
        Master Cam and Revit. Students will have access to multiple

        cutters, laser engravers and 3D printers. This course will look at
        mechanical and architectural drawing and design using a
        combination of manual and computer drafting. While CAD will
        be primarily used, sketching and hand drawing will allow the
        students to develop their skills around drafting conventions
        such as lettering, dimensioning and view projection. Through a

    <p class="texts">
        This course focuses on the combination of mechanical
        engineering and electronics. Students will use computer aided
        drafting programs to create and rapidly prototype different
        movements. These movements will be powered first by
        hydraulics and then by electronic systems. The projects will be
        challenge based, and the movements are graded on their ability
        to complete the separate challenges. Technology used in this
        course: vinyl cutter, laser engraver, 3D printer and hotwire
        cutters.</p>
