  The Mathematics curriculum is designed to give all students the opportunity to learn skills to successfully locate,
  analyze and apply the information they need in their work and personal lives after they graduate. They include the 
  four major strands of competencies that are critical to students' learning, doing and understanding Mathematics.
  
  <p>
  
  <b>Reasoning and Analyzing</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Demonstrate fluency with mental mathematics and estimation
    <li>Develop inductive and deductive mathematical reasoning
    <li>Use tools or technology to explore and create patterns and relationships, and test conjectures 
  </ul>
  
  <b>Understanding and Solving</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Develop, construct and apply new mathematical knowledge through play, inquiry, and problem solving
    <li>Demonstrate multiple strategies to solve problems in both abstract and real-life situations using different 
        cultural perspectives
  </ul>
  
  <b>Communicating and Representing</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Use mathematical vocabulary and language to communicate in a variety of ways to explain, clarify, and justify ideas
    <li>Develop mathematical understanding through concrete, pictorial and symbolic representations
  </ul>

  <b>Connecting and Reflecting</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Develop visualization skills to assist in exploring, connecting, applying, and describing concepts to each
        other, to other disciplines, and to the real world
  </ul>
  
  <p>It is advised that both parents and students maintain contact with the Math teacher when concerns or questions 
  arise concerning Math placements. In addition, please check with post-secondary institutions for requirements of math 
  courses and grades in specific programs. The <a href="/forms#math-flowchart">Math Flowchart</a> is available as a
  reference for choosing courses based on your post-secondary goals.

          This is an excellent preparatory course for first year University Mathematics. The course content is mostly 
          differentiation with applications and introduction of basic integration. (Students registered in Calculus 12 
          may write the UBC/SFU/UNBC/UVIC Challenge Exam in the first week of June.) A percentage with a letter grade is
          mailed directly to the student's home address. The student may then present this credit to local institutions 
          within British Columbia to receive their first year Calculus credit.
