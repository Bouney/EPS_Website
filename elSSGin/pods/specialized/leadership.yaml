          Elgin's Co-op Program is a cohort of students that includes set
          academic courses, two work experiences (without missing instructional
          time), customer service training, completion of Career Life
          Connections 12 and a variety of field trips related to curriculum and
          careers. Instead of the standard 16 credit semester, co-op students
          receive 20 credits.
          
          <p><strong>An <a href="/forms#TODO">application form</a> must be
          submitted to the Career Centre to be considered for
          this program.</strong>
          
          <p>The application process begins in grade 10 and
          is based on academics, attitude, work habits and attendance. There may
          also be an interview component to determine participants.
          
          <p>Co-op provides students with a competitive edge in terms of post secondary
          applications and employment. The work experiences, combined with the
          CLC 12 curriculum prepare students for post-secondary and career
          decisions.<p>Co-op includes Language Arts 11, Law 12, Work Experience
          12 A & B and Career Life Connections 12

              Students do not miss any instructional time from
              classes while on work experience,however, due to the fact that
              students will be absent from the classroom, and receiving "on the job
              training"during the work experience portion of the co-op program, the
              remaining curricular areas will be faster paced during the time the

              Due to the pace of the curricular
