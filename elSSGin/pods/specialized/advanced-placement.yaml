          AP Computer Science 12 is a course for students interested in digging deep into the technical side of computer
          programming. It is a fast-paced and intensive course that takes students who have experience in programming
          (Python, C++, or Java) and goes into an intensive level of programming in Java language. It emphasizes
          object-oriented programming methodology in Java and focuses on problem solving and algorithm development. The 
          course will cover the equivalent of a one semester course in computer science at most post-secondary
          institutions. Students who successfully meet the required standards in the AP Computer Science A Exam may use
          this course credit at the post-secondary institution of their choice.

          This course is for students who are dedicated to developing their art portfolio for post-secondary studies in 
          Studio Art and Design programs.

          <p>Students signing up for the Advanced Placement programs must be prepared for the rigorous amount of time 
          and effort required both in and out of class needed to develop their art portfolio.
          
          <p>If you want to take <b>Pre-Advance Placement Art</b>, you should sign up for PKG--11--8. If you want to 
          take <b>Advance Placement Art 12</b>, you should sign up for PKG--12--6.
      - name: Advanced Placement Calculus 12

          This is an excellent preparatory course for first and second year university Mathematics. The AP course 
          content is differentiation and integration with applications of the two. Students registered in AP Calc 12 are 
          encouraged to write the AP (Advanced Placement) Exam in May.
          
          <p>This course is offered as a linear program with Pre-Calculus Math 12. Students are required to take both
          Pre-Calculus Math 12 and AP Calculus 12 in this program. <strong>It is stressed that students verify
          prerequisite math courses and grades</strong> to specific programs at post-secondary institutions. The
