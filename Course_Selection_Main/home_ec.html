                    Students will supply own fabric, patterns and notions. There are 3 areas of study that will be covered throughout the course:
                    <br><br>Sewing: Students will refresh their knowledge of the sewing machine operation and be introduced to the serger. They will complete various sample projects to develop and practice new skills. Students will also be offered flexibility
                    of working on personal projects based on independent study and interest.
                    <br><br>Arts and Design: Another area of textiles includes DIY crafts and does not always include use of a sewing machine. Projects may include soft sculptures, upcycled projects, holiday crafts, knitting and crocheting, jewelry making
                    and home decor items. Students will identify various principles and elements of design from other cultures and learn about textile fundamentals.
                    <br><br>Patterning and Costumes: Express your creativity through pattern drafting and garment construction. Students will cover topics such as figure shape analysis, colour and design, wardrobe planning, clothing alterations, natural
                    and synthetic fibres as well as fashion history and trends.</p>
