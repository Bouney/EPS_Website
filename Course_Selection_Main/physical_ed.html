                    This course is designed to provide students with an opportunity to improve skills through sport. The foundation of the course will be to acquire advanced volleyball skills and strategies: individual and team defense, blocking, setting, serving, and individual and team offense, in both indoor (6 v 6) and beach (2 v 2) volleyball. Sport-specific training is included and will cover core strength training, flexibility, speed and agility. All students will go through Level 1 Officials training (Novice or Local) and be accredited volleyball officials. Rules and scorekeeping will be taught so students may act as minor officials and scorekeepers for league and tournament matches. Introductory coaching techniques will be taught, and students will have the opportunity to show leadership by teaching skills to peers and/or students outside the school. Finally, there will be a mental training and team-building component in this course.
