                    <p class="texts">AP Computer Science 12 is a course for students interested in digging deep into the technical side of computer programming. It is a fast-paced and intensive course that takes students who have experience in programming (Python, C++,
                        or Java) and goes into an intensive level of programming in Java language. It emphasizes object-oriented programming methodology in Java and focuses on problem solving and algorithm development. The course will cover the equivalent
                        of a one semester course in computer science at most post-secondary institutions. Students who successfully meet the required standards in the AP Computer Science A Exam may use this course credit at the post-secondary institution
                        of their choice.</p>

                        <p class="texts">This is an excellent preparatory course for first and second year university Mathematics. The AP course content is differentiation and integration with applications of the two. Students registered in AP CALC 12 are encouraged to
                            write the AP (Advanced Placement) Exam in May.<br><br>This course is offered as a linear program with Pre-Calculus Math 12. Students are required to take both Pre-Calculus Math 12 and AP Calculus 12 in this program.
                            <b>It is stressed that students verify prerequisite math courses 
and grades to specific programs at post-secondary 
institutions.</b></p>
