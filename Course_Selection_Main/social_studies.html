                        World history examines the world of 1900-2000 and the global forces that have shaped our current society. The breakdown of long-standing empires created new economic and political systems. Nationalist movements would both united peoples and cause lasting
                        conflicts. A common thread throughout this time period was the rapid development and proliferation of technology which altered all aspects of our society. Using historical inquiry students will investigate these global and international
                        co-operation, as well as the growth of hu-man rights movements. History will enable students to better understand and navigate the world in which they live.</p>
