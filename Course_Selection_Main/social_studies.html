                    World history examines the world of 1900-2000 and the global forces that have shaped our current society. The breakdown of long-standing empires created new economic and political systems. Nationalist movements would both unite peoples and cause lasting conflicts. A common thread throughout this time period was the rapid development and proliferation of technology which altered all aspects of our society. Using historical inquiry students will investigate these global and international co-operation, as well as the growth of human rights movements. History will enable students to better understand and navigate the world in which they live.

This can include the study of cultural elements like language, religion, art, music, and different government structures. The types of questions we will explore include: Where do people live and why? How have government attempts at population control, such as China's One Child Policy, impacted the social, cultural, and demographic composition of a country? Where and how is food produced? How does religion influence political conflicts in areas such as the Middle East and Eastern Europe? You will be given authentic, real-life problems, and will show your learning by researching and proposing solutions.
