                <p class="texts">The English Language Learner (ELL) program at Elgin Park is set up on an immersion basis. ELL students are integrated into mainstream classes (academic and/or electives) for all blocks, with the exception of their ELL classes. Placement
                    into the program is determined following the results of their initial placement test prior to starting classes at Elgin Park.</p>
                <ol id="lit">
                    <b>The ELL Levels are:</b>

                <p class="texts">
                    Level 1 to Level 3 students are usually enrolled in at least one ELL class per semester (direct support).<br> Level 4 and Level 5 students will typically be in mainstream classes (indirect support).<br> The ELL classes are divided
                    into three progressive levels. <b>The Level 3 courses will count as 4 credits each.</b>

                <p class="texts">Progress through the levels will be dependent upon each student's rate of language acquisition, which in turn will be influenced by a number of factors such as motivation and the length of time in the target language. Advancement up the
                    levels will be determined in part by the results of the annual ELL Testing as recommended by both the District and the Ministry of Education. Other factors such as academic class marks and/or teacher recommendation will also be used
                    to determine placement.<br>ELL students will continue to be monitored and tested yearly by the ELL teacher, typically in Spring.<br> Students exiting from the ELL program have met one of the following criteria:

<h1>LEARNING SUPPORT TEAM</h1>
  <p class="texts">
    The Learning Support Team (LST) at Elgin Park provides instruction to support students' identified learning needs and educational goals.<br><br>
Students are either assigned a period for learning support; in place of an elective course, or use the LST centre on a drop-in basis for extra assistance with classroom work, independent study, project completion or test taking.<br><br>
Our goal is to provide students a supportive, safe, and welcoming environment where they can become more efficient and confident with their own learning styles and learning strategies. LST staff assist students with their learning needs by teaching them skills to complete their homework and projects. We work with teachers to support students' pedagogical needs by providing and encouraging a variety of differentiated instruction techniques. LST staff also liaise with parents on an ongoing basis in order to help support their children at home.<br><br>
Entry into LST is through a teacher and/or parent referral process. If you believe that your child needs LST support, please contact your child's counsellor.<br><br>
Depending on their IEP, students enrolled in a LST block may be assigned one of the following courses:<br><br>

    <div><span class="grade10">10</span><span class="grade11">11</span><span class="grade11">12</span></div>
    <p class="texts">Strategies for Learning 10-12 are designed to provide instruction in effective self-regulation and strategic learning for students with learning difficulties. Instruction focusses on developing skills and strategies which enable students to become effective and independent learners. Emphasis is placed on the transfer of these skills and strategies to all subject areas.</p>-->
