            <h2>ELL Program Overview</h2>
            <p>The English Language Learner (ELL) program at Elgin Park is set up on an immersion basis. ELL students are integrated into mainstream classes (academic and/or electives) for all blocks, with the exception of their ELL classes. Placement into the program is determined following the results of their initial placement test prior to starting classes at Elgin Park.</p>
            <p><strong>The ELL Levels are:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Level 1 (Beginning)</li>
                <li>Level 2 (Developing)</li>
                <li>Level 3 (Expanding)</li>
                <li>Level 4 (Consolidating)</li>
                <li>Level 5 (Bridging)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Level 1 to Level 3 students are usually enrolled in at least one ELL class per semester (direct support).<br>
                Level 4 and Level 5 students will typically be in mainstream classes (indirect support).<br>
                The ELL classes are divided into three progressive levels. <strong>The Level 3 courses will count as 4 credits each.</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Level 1 - Canadian Culture class</li>
                <li>Level 2 - Beginner 2 class</li>
                <li>Level 3 - Introduction to Academic Language ELL 10 - Academic Language ELL 10</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Progress through the levels will be dependent upon each student's rate of language acquisition, influenced by factors such as motivation and time in the target language. Advancement is determined partly by annual ELL Testing results, academic class marks, and/or teacher recommendation. ELL students are monitored and tested yearly. Students exiting the ELL program have met criteria such as 5+ years of language instruction in Surrey, achieving Bridging level on assessment and teacher recommendation, or School Based Team approval.</p>
