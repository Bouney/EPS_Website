        <div class="content-section">
            <p>Media Arts (Film) & Photography courses provide students with a guided process that improves photography, film making, digital art and problem-based learning skills. General requirements: research, concept development, draft development, final copy-editing, and self-critiquing. Opportunities for self-exploration, experimentation, contract projects, and exhibiting pieces. Student success depends on personal maturity and willingness to do "prescribed" learning tasks methodically and timely.</p>
            <p><strong>Projects:</strong> To facilitate "real" learning, students are provided with clear steps and expectations for their projects (four in number), with reasonable timelines (typically four weeks). Assignment expectations are reviewed many times. Outside-of-class time is available for clarification. Weekly skill-building tutorials and in-class assignments are also completed.</p>
