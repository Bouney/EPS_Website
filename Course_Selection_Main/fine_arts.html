                <h2>Overview:</h2>
                <p class="texts">Media Arts (Film) & Photography courses provide students with a guided process that improves photography, film making, digital art and problem based learning skills. The general requirements for each assignment are to do research, concept
                    development, draft development, final copy-editing and self-critiquing. There are also many opportunities for self-exploration, experimentation, contract projects and exhibiting your pieces in the school and community. Student success
                    depends on personal maturity a willingness to do "prescribed" learning tasks in a methodical and timely manner.

                <h2>Projects:</h2>

                <p class="texts">To facilitate "real" learning, students are provided with clear steps and expectations to carry out their projects (four in number), as well as reasonable timelines - typically, four weeks. The assignment expectations are reviewed many
                    times during the month. As well, outside of class-time is available to clarify comprehension related questions. Additionally, students will complete weekly skill building tutorials and in class assignments.</p>
