                    This course provides a firm grounding in the discipline of Physics and the treatment of topics is mathematically much more rigorous than in Physics 11. Physics 12 is designed to help upon communication and collaborative skills essential
                    for success both in school and in work. Students who are passionate about learning and immersing themselves in the environment and/or are interested in pursuing a career in environmental engineering, mining, forestry, political science,
                    social justice, environmental assessment, geology or even construction would be well-suited for this program. This course also meets the requirements for CLC 12, including the completion of the Capstone project. Other CLC components
                    include: self-exploration, career and university research, post-graduation plans, volunteerism, personal branding, budgeting, health and wellness, scholarship applications, resumes and cover letters. Successful completion of this course
                    is a graduation requirement.

                    This course is an extension of materials studied in Science 10 and Chemistry 11. Units of study include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Chemical reactions and their rates</li>
                        <li>Chemical equilibrium</li>

                        <li>Electrochemistry</li>
                    </ul>
                    Successful students will require strong math skills and problem-solving abilities, and will work to further improve these skills during the course. It is recommended that students have a grade of B or better in both Chemistry 11 & Math 11.

                    This is a comprehensive course which furthers the understanding of the human body from the molecular level to specialized organ systems with specific functions. It is strongly recommended students have taken Life Sciences 11 and Chemistry
                    11. Units of study include homeostasis and biochemistry, DNA and cellular processes and in-depth study of organ systems of the human body. There is a lab component in this course that includes dissection of animal organs.

                    (A 2-3 day training session for Lab Assistants will take place near the end of June; exact dates yet to be determined.) Students who want to take part in the Lab Assistant program must:
                    <ul>
                        <li>have achieved an A in Science 10.</li>
                        <li>have demonstrated strong laboratory skills.</li>
                        <li>have good communication skills.</li>
                        <li>be willing to help support younger students.</li>
                        <li>be excellent role models as active learners.</li>
                        <li>be recommended by a science teacher.</li>
                        <li>complete an application - please see your Science 10 teacher.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Lab Assistant 11 is a course in which students will assist in junior science classrooms during labs. Lab Assistants may be assigned to different junior science classes each day depending on which classes are conducting labs. While assisting in junior
                    science classes, Lab Assistants may be required to help junior students interpret lab instructions, identify materials and reagents, observe lab safety procedures, perform experiments, and interpret lab results.
                    <br><br>
                    The process of instructing others will require Lab Assistants to reflect on their own learning and knowledge in sciences. Therefore, students who wish to focus on sciences in their senior years will benefit from the attention to lab skills required in
                    modeling and teaching to peers in junior grades. This course can be an excellent prelude to the Lab Tech 12 course but is open to students in grade 11 or 12.
