                    (A 2-3 day training session for Lab Assistants will take place near the end of June; exact dates yet to be determined.) Students who want to take part in the Lab Assistant program must:
                    <ul id="lit">
                        <li>have achieved an A in Science 10.</li>
                        <li>have demonstrated strong laboratory skills.</li>
                        <li>have good communication skills.</li>
                        <li>be willing to help support younger students.</li>
                        <li>be excellent role models as active learners.</li>
                        <li>be recommended by a science teacher.</li>
                        <li>complete an application - please see your Science 10 teacher.</li>

                        Lab Assistant 11 is a course in which students will assist in junior science classrooms during labs. Lab Assistants may be assigned to different junior science classes each day depending on which classes are conducting labs. While assisting in junior
                        science classes, Lab Assistants may be required to help junior students interpret lab instructions, identify materials and reagents, observe lab safety procedures, perform experiments, and interpret lab results.
                    </p>
                    <p class="texts">
                        The process of instructing others will require Lab Assistants to reflect on their own learning and knowledge in sciences. Therefore, students who wish to focus on sciences in their senior years will benefit from the attention to lab skills required in
                        modeling and teaching to peers in junior grades. This course can be an excellent prelude to the Lab Tech 12 course but is open to students in grade 11 or 12.
