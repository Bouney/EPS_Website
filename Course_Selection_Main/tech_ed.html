                    Are you interested in welding, art metal, or building things out of metal? This course may be for you. In Metalwork 9/10 we use hand and power tools to build a number of practical and artistic projects. Project examples may include, rings, bracelets, tools, boxes, bowls, and figures. Safety in the shop area is our top priority and practiced throughout the course. At the 9/10 level students are introduced to different kinds of welding, various types of materials, and the use of a lathe and milling machine.

                    <b>(Recommended Prerequisite: Drafting 10)</b><br>
                    This course is designed to accommodate a wide range of student ability. Drafting 11 is designed to develop sound basics of graphic representation through the use of CAD workstations, drafting machines and drafting instruments. Students will have access to multiple technologies including vinyl cutters, soldering irons, hot wire cutters, laser engravers and 3D printers. Students are encouraged to work at their own pace while striving to improve themselves. They should find satisfaction in their progress and skill development as careful, quality work is stressed while communicating through graphic representation. Pictorials, Renderings, Orthographic and Isometric Projections will be used to develop skill and design appreciation by the student. In addition, relationships between form and function will be explored. This course will help students acquire the skills and knowledge needed to pursue post secondary training for careers as technologists, draftsmen, fashion design, interior design, technicians, architects, engineers and industrial design specialists.

                    <b>(Recommended Prerequisite: Drafting 11)</b><br>
                    This Computer Aided Drafting and Design course builds on the skills and fundamentals taught in TED 10 or DDF 11. Three dimensional models and animations are created using AutoCAD, Master Cam and Revit. Students will have access to multiple technologies including vinyl cutters, soldering irons, hot wire cutters, laser engravers and 3D printers. This course will look at mechanical and architectural drawing and design using a combination of manual and computer drafting. While CAD will be primarily used, sketching and hand drawing will allow the students to develop their skills around drafting conventions such as lettering, dimensioning and view projection. Through a series of teacher and student designed projects, students will gain an appreciation for drafting and the asset that it can be in life, school, and career options.

                    This course focuses on the combination of mechanical engineering and electronics. Students will use computer aided drafting programs to create and rapidly prototype different movements. These movements will be powered first by hydraulics and then by electronic systems. The projects will be challenge based, and the movements are graded on their ability to complete the separate challenges. Technology used in this course: vinyl cutter, laser engraver, 3D printer and hotwire cutters.

                Industrial Design is the link between innovation and creativity and allows us to tackle a given situation both imaginatively as well as critically. This class uses design problems inspired by realistic scenarios, even using existing briefs from design firms and industry grade materials to give a more authentic learning experience. Throughout the semester, we will be practising fundamental skills and concepts of industrial and product design. We will also learn how to present and document not only our products but creative processes in a professional manner. This class highly encourages creativity and attempts at sourcing out materials to supplement the deliverables.

            <p>
                To demonstrate student learning, they will be given various opportunities to practise and develop technical skills through hands-on learning during studio classes. A final project will be handed in at the end of each unit for marking. Research and step by step process photos must also be professionally documented and compiled digitally on one page as well as a final product shot to be included in the final unit hand-

                    Social Dynamics in Tabletop Role Playing Games (TTRPGs) is a course for students who desire to strengthen their interpersonal and leadership skills through project-based, collaborative learning. This course will allow students to develop and further their understanding of intentional and purposeful design skills and they will be able to learn how to use various Computer Aided Design (CAD) programs in order to bring their creations to life through 3D printing. Programs that students will be able to utilize include AutoCAD, Sketchup, and Cura in order to 3D print the finalized designs. The course will draw from various forms of tabletop games including miniatures, card, and board games in order for students to develop and actualize their own creations.
