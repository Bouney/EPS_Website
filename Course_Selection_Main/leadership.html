                    Elgin's Co-op Program is a cohort of students that includes set academic courses, two work experiences (without missing instructional time), customer service training, completion of Career Life Connections 12 and a variety of field trips
                    related to curriculum and careers. Instead of the standard 16 credit semester, co-op students receive 20 credits.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    <strong>An application <a href="forms.html">MUST be submitted (click here)</a>.</strong> The application process begins in Gr. 10 and is based on academics, attitude, work habits, and attendance; an interview may also be required to determine participants.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    Co-op provides students with a competitive edge in terms of post-secondary applications and employment. The work experiences, combined with the CLC 12 curriculum, prepare students for post-secondary and career decisions.
