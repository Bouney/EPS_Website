## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The **EPS Website** is the digital platform for Elgin Park School, designed to provide students, staff, and the community with easy access to information and resources.

With the 2024â€“2025 update, the website switches to a completely new platform, elSSGin, data being stored in JSON files rather than raw HTML, allowing easier maintenance.
